[See upstream docs](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/blob/master/doc/development/adding_a_cask.md). These include how to

* [create new casks](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/blob/master/doc/development/adding_a_cask.md#adding-a-cask)
* [test casks locally](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/blob/master/doc/development/adding_a_cask.md#testing-your-new-cask)

To add new versions, harvest them from the upstream tap's repository, at the version that we wish to support.

Upstream taps:
* [caskroom](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask) (`Casks` directory)
* [homebrew](https://github.com/homebrew/homebrew-core) (`Formula` directory)
